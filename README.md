# Intro

Alien is a novel Generalized Federated Anomaly Detection Framework Based on Challenging Cases. In Alien, a certified radius based approaching distribution enhances local generalization, and a coherence constrained diverse aggregation mechanism accomplishes promising global generalization.

# Usage

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main_fed.py
```

Methods have been implemented in the model folder and can be imported for substitution. For example:
```
Replace local = LocalUpdate() with LocalUpdateRadius()
```
